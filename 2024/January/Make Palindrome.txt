Read t  // Number of test cases

for each test case in range(t):

    Read s  // The string

    Initialize an empty dictionary m

    // Count the occurrences of each character in the string
    for each character x in s:
        Increment m[x] by 1

    Initialize o to 0  // Variable to count characters with odd occurrences

    // Count the number of characters with odd occurrences
    for each value x in m.values():

            Increment o by 1

    Print max(0, o - 1)  // Print the result for the current test case
