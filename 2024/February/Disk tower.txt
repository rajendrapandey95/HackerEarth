Function SolveTower(N, a):
    Initialize an empty array ans
    Initialize done to N
    Initialize an empty priority queue pq
    
    For each element x in array a:
        Push x to the priority queue pq
        Initialize an empty array aux
        While pq is not empty and the top element of pq equals done:
            Append done to aux
            Pop from pq
            Decrement done by 1
        Append aux to ans
    
    Sort array a in non-decreasing order
    Remove duplicate elements from array a
    
    Ensure that the size of array a is equal to N
    
    Return ans

Function main():
    Read an integer N from standard input
    Assert that N is between 1 and 10^6
    
    Read N integers into array a from standard input
    Assert that the size of array a is equal to N
    
    Call SolveTower(N, a) and store the result in out_
    
    For each row in out_:
        For each element in the row:
            Print the element followed by a space
        Print a newline
    
Call main()
