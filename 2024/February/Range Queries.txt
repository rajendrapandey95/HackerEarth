Declare a 2D array a with dimensions [100005][20] of integers

Function pre_process():
    For i = 1 to 100000:
        Set val = 1
        For j = 1 to 20:
            If val is less than or equal to i:
                If i bitwise AND val is non-zero:
                    Set a[i][j] = 1
                Multiply val by 2

    For i = 1 to 20:
        For j = 1 to 100000:
            Set a[j][i] = a[j - 1][i] + a[j][i]

Function main():
    Call pre_process()

    Read integer q from input

    Repeat q times:
        Read integers l, r, and x from input
        Set answer = a[r][x] - a[l - 1][x]
        Print answer

Call main()
