Input:
- n: integer (number of elements)
- a: list of integers (input array of length n)

Procedure calculate_pairs(n, a):
    Initialize two empty dictionaries mp1 and mp2
    
    For each index i from 0 to n-1:
        Calculate key1 as a[i] + (i + 1)^2
        Update mp1[key1] by incrementing its count
    
    For each index i from 0 to n-1:
        Calculate key2 as a[i] - (i + 1)^2
        Update mp2[key2] by incrementing its count
    
    Initialize cnt as 0
    
    For each key in mp1:
        Increment cnt by the product of mp2[key] and mp1[key]
    
    Output cnt

Main:
    Read n from input
    Read array a from input
    
    Call calculate_pairs(n, a) and output the result
