Define maxn as 1e6 + 17
Declare an array phi of size maxn to store Euler's Totient Function values
Declare an array divs of size maxn to store the number of divisors for each number
Initialize phi and divs arrays with zeros

For i from 1 to maxn - 1:
    Increment phi[i] by i
    For j from i * 2 to maxn - 1 with a step of i:
        Subtract phi[i] from phi[j]
    For j from i to maxn - 1 with a step of i:
        Increment divs[j] by 1

Read an integer q representing the number of queries

While q is greater than 0:
    Read an integer n
    Print n - phi[n] - divs[n] + 1
    Decrement q by 1
