Function solve():
    Read input string s
    Sort the characters of s in non-decreasing order

    If first character of s is equal to last character of s:
        Print -1
    Else:
        Print s

Function main():
    Read number of test cases t
    Repeat t times:
        Call solve() function

Call main() function
