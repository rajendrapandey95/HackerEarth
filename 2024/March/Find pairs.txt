Function solve():
    Read input n from standard input

    Define a vector a of size n
    Define a map m of integers to integers

    For i = 0 to n-1:
        Read a[i] from standard input
        Increment m[a[i] - i]

    Initialize c to 0

    For each pair [key, value] in m:
        Add (value * (value - 1)) to c

    Print c to standard output

Function main():
    Disable synchronization with C standard streams
    Untie input and output streams

    Call solve()

    Exit program with status 0
