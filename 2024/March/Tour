Define a map p: string to integer
Define a 2D array arr of size (1000 + 1) x (1000 + 1)

Function main():
    Declare variables: n, m, tem1, ans
    Read n from input

    For i from 0 to n - 1:
        Read a string s from input
        Map s to i in p

    For i from 0 to n - 1:
        For j from 0 to n - 1:
            Read tem1 from input
            Set arr[i][j] = tem1

    Read m from input
    Set last = 0

    For i from 0 to m - 1:
        Read a string s from input
        Add arr[last][p[s]] to ans
        Set last = p[s]

    Print ans
