Set tc as the input for the number of test cases

While tc is greater than 0:
    Decrement tc by 1
    Take input n for the current test case
    
    Convert n to a string m
    
    Check if '21' is present in m or if n is divisible by 21:
        If true, print "The streak is broken!"
        If false, print "The streak lives still in our heart!"
