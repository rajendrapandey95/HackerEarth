Function f(n, k):
    If n equals 0:
        Return 0
    Set res to n divided by k
    Return f(n divided by k, k) plus n times (n plus 1) divided by 2 minus (res times (res plus 1) divided by 2) times k

Function main():
    Read the integer T from input
    Assert that T is between 1 and 300,000 inclusive
    Repeat T times:
        Read integers n and k from input
        Assert that n is less than or equal to 1 billion
        Assert that k is between 2 and 1 billion inclusive
        Print f(n, k)

If the script is executed directly:
    Call the main function
