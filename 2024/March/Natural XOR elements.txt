Define a function main():
    Read the number of test cases, t.
    Loop over each test case:
        Read the value of n.
        Determine the value of n modulo 4:
            If n % 4 is 0:
                Print "1" followed by the value of n.
            If n % 4 is 1:
                Print "1" followed by "1".
            If n % 4 is 2:
                Print "2" followed by the value of n and the bitwise XOR of n and n+1.
            If n % 4 is 3:
                Print "0".
                
If the script is executed directly:
    Call the main function.
