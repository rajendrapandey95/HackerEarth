Define DEBUG as a boolean constant indicating whether debug mode is enabled

Define function pb as a macro for push_back
Define macros for accessing the first and second elements of a pair: X and Y

Define typedefs for commonly used types: ll (long long), ld (long double), pii (pair of integers), piii (pair of integer pairs), pll (pair of long longs), and point (pair of pairs of integers)

Define constants for maximum array size (maxn), infinity (INF), modulo value (M), and logarithmic value (lg)

Define main function:
    Disable synchronization with standard C and C++ streams and untie cin, cout, and cerr
    Declare variables n and r of type long long
    Read input for n and r from standard input

    Declare a vector a of pairs of long longs to store balloon coordinates

    Loop from i = 0 to n - 1:
        Read input for a[i].X and a[i].Y (coordinates of each balloon) from standard input

    Output the value of n to standard output
    Loop from i = 0 to n - 1:
        Output the coordinates of each balloon (a[i].X and a[i].Y) to standard output

    Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program
