For each test case:
    Read the number of integers n
    Initialize a variable g to 0
    For i from 0 to n-1:
        Read the next integer x
        If i is 0:
            Set g to x
        Else:
            Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of g and x
            Update g with the calculated GCD
    If the final value of g is 1:
        Print "FINITE"
    Else:
        Print "INFINITE"
