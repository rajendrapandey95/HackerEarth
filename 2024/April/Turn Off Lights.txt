Function solve():
    Read integers n and k from input
    Read string s from input

    Initialize variables lo = 1, hi = n, c = 1

    While lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        Initialize variables ind = 0, l = 0
        While ind < n:
            if s[ind] == '0':
                Increment ind by 1
            else:
                Increment l by 1
                Increment ind by mid
        If l <= k:
            Update c to mid
            Set hi to mid - 1
        Else:
            Set lo to mid + 1

    Print c

Main:
    Call solve function if the script is run as the main program
