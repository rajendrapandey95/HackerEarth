Input: 
    t: integer (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        n: integer (number of elements in the list)
        k: integer (constraint)
        List of integers

Process:
    Loop while t > 0:
        Decrement t by 1
        Read n, k, and the list of integers
        Calculate the sum of the integers in the list
        Calculate the maximum value satisfying the condition: max(0, s // (k + 1) - n + 1)
        Print the maximum value

Output:
    Maximum value satisfying the condition for each test case
