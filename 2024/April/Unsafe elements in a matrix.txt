Function MaximizeGridAreas(t: int):
    For each test case in range t:
        Read n, m from input
        Initialize rmx, cmx, rmn, cmn arrays of size n and m respectively, with INT_MIN and INT_MAX
        For each row i from 0 to n - 1:
            For each column j from 0 to m - 1:
                Read x from input
                Update rmx[i] to max(rmx[i], x)
                Update cmx[j] to max(cmx[j], x)
                Update rmn[i] to min(rmn[i], x)
                Update cmn[j] to min(cmn[j], x)
        Find mx as maximum value in rmx array
        Find mn as minimum value in rmn array
        Initialize r and c as 0
        For each row i from 0 to n - 1:
            If rmn[i] is not equal to mn and rmx[i] is not equal to mx:
                Increment r by 1
        For each column j from 0 to m - 1:
            If cmn[j] is not equal to mn and cmx[j] is not equal to mx:
                Increment c by 1
        Print c multiplied by r
