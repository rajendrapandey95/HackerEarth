Define constant N as 2333
Define constant eps as 1e-7

Create a structure for pairs of integers and doubles, named PairIntDouble:
    - Define two fields: first (integer) and second (double)

Create a structure for pairs of integers, named PairInt:
    - Define two fields: first and second, both integers

Declare an array s of PairIntDouble with size N
Declare an array t of PairIntDouble with size N
Declare an array f of PairInt with size N
Declare integers n and c

Define a function dfs(x, l, r):
    - If x equals n:
        - If r is less than eps:
            - Initialize integer v as 1
            - Iterate over each element in t:
                - Update v to be the result of v divided by the greatest common divisor of v and the first field of the current element in t, multiplied by the first field of the current element in t
            - Set the second field of f at index c to v
            - Set the first field of f at index c to 1
            - Iterate over each element in t:
                - Multiply the first field of f at index c by the first field of the current element in t
            - Increment c by 1
    - Else:
        - If r is less than eps, return
        - While the second field of s at index l multiplied by (n minus x) is greater than or equal to r minus eps:
            - Set the x-th element of t to the element at index l of array s
            - If the second field of s at index l is less than or equal to r plus eps, recursively call dfs with arguments x plus 1, l, and r minus the second field of s at index l
            - Increment l by 1

Define the main function:
    - Read an integer T from input
    - Repeat T times:
        - Read an integer n from input
        - Initialize ans as -1
        - Iterate over each element in f:
            - If n modulo the second field of the current element is equal to 0:
                - Set ans to the result of n multiplied by n multiplied by n multiplied by n, divided by the first field of the current element
                - Break the loop
        - Print ans followed by a newline character

End of main function
