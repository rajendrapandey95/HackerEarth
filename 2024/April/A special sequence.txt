Initialize an array 'a' with a single element '2'
While the last element of 'a' is less than 1e13:
    Calculate the next element by adding:
        The last element of 'a'
        The square root of the length of 'a' plus 1, multiplied by the length of 'a'
        (The length of 'a' plus 1) divided by 2
    Append the calculated value to 'a'
Read the number of queries 'q'
Repeat 'q' times:
    Read the range 'l' and 'r'
    Find the leftmost index of 'a' where the value is greater than or equal to 'l'
    Find the leftmost index of 'a' where the value is greater than or equal to 'r'
    Print the difference between the indices found in the previous steps, plus 1
